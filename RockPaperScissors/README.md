# 06 - Rock, Paper, Scissor, Spock, Lizard

Even though the code could probably be prettier, I'm actually pretty satisfied with my solution to this one.

Let's not get into how long I spent fiddling with arrays and dictionaries before it occured to me though.

###### Example output

**Main menu**
```
 What would you like to play?
>Classic Rock, Paper, Scissor
 Extended (+Spock, Lizard)
 Exit
```

**Game**
```
 Pick your hand:
 Rock
 Paper
>Scissor
 Spock
 Lizard
 Computer picked Lizard
Well yeah, Scissor beats Lizard, although you probably cheated... Let's try again?
```
