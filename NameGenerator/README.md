# 00 Name generator

### Elvish name generator.
A very simple console application. There are no settings. Press a key to generate a new name.

Works by simply picking some syllables from an array, and concatenate them to a name.

###### Example output
```
Press <Q> or <ESC> to quit. Any other key to generate another name
Thalarilfin
```

### Ideas for improvements

- [ ] Load syllables from a JSON or YAML file
- [ ] Make more complex rules for higher quality names
- [ ] Option to generate in batch and output to a file
